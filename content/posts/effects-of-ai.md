I have been thinking about what makes something disruptive. Instead of asking about the intrinsic nature of a technology, a thinking about what becomes commodified gets at how a society is changed. 

Where I don't claim this approach is universal, I think it is still productive.

To explain this idea I will give a few historical examples.

## Farming: food 

Before farming food gathering was high intensity  work with a random pay out. One might spend all day gathering or hunting only to come back will a modest meal. 

Farming changed this, where there are still crop failures, overall farming increases the amount of food a single person can acquire and evens out  rewards. The eventual result of this being commodification of food production.

The impact of this on society can not be understated as it led to the transition from nomadic life and the entablement of permanent settlements. 

## Industrialization: Goods

Pre-industrialization many goods were very valuable. Cloth for instance, was a one of the most expensive items someone might own. Prior to industrialization,  most people owned at most a few sets of clothing.

The move to industrialization has led us all the way to our modern relationship with fabric where outfits are replaced seasonally or more often.

Socially this has lead huge over consumption and waist with the adage american disposing of 81.5 pounds of textiles a year. This is only a small example of the dramatic effects of the industrialization of textiles has had on society. 

## Computers thought the 1980's: computation

Prior the the invention of computers computation was very expensive. The term computer originally referred to an occupation not a device, and the results of useful mathematical calculations such as logarithms were worth publishing in books to save time and expense.

By the 70's digital calculators had made simple computation broadly affordable and by the end of the 80's home computers had made computation so cheep that it was regularly used for entertainment (read computer games).

Agin the social impacts of computers are far reaching. To focus on one, our modern money system, taxes, markets, and banking depend on computers to function.

## Looking forward to AI

I provide these examples, farming, industrialization, and computers, to show that impacts of commodification caused by a technology.


This brings me to the core question I want to ask: What dose and what will AI commoditize?

Language? Knowledge? Inelegance?
What kinds of impact can we expect if each of these truly becomes a commodity?

## Computers 1990's - now:  

Information
Stories and information was once carried verbally, then as writing and to books which were only affordable to the rich. The printing press and news papers made information more accessible but the internet brought the marginal cost of publishing the written word to zero. It has still been expensive to write text but  costs almost nothing to distribute. 

Other kinds of media, audio, images, and video, have also become much cheaper to distribute.
