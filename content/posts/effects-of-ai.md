I have been thinking about disruption and how to think about what makes something disruptive. I don't think this approach covers all disruptive changes but I think it is still useful.
For this I am going to talk about tech, but I am not going to talk about the tech but what it computerized.
This is going to be a somewhat random list.
Farming: food. 

Before farming food was often  high intensity  work with a random pay out. One might spend all day looking for food or hunting only to come back will only a modest amount or one might find all that can be carried as soon as you head out.

Farming changed this, where there are still crop failures over all farming increases the amount of food a single person can acquire and evens out  rewards. The eventual result of this being that food is not a commodity.

Industrialization: Goods

Pre-industrialization many goods were very valuable. For instance  cloth was a one of the most expensive things someone might own with most people owning at most a few sets of clothing.
Computers thought the 1980's: computation

Prior the the invention of computers computation was very expensive. (The term computer originally referred to an occupation not a device)  Errors were common; published log tables would have errata where the errata had errata recursively. 

By the 70's digital calculators had made simple computation broadly affordable and by the end of the 80's home computers had made computation so cheep that it was regularly used for entertainment (read computer games).

Computers 1990's - now:  Information
Stories and information was once carried verbally, then as writing and to books which were only affordable to the rich. The printing press and news papers made information more accessible but the internet brought the marginal cost of publishing the written word to zero. It has still been expensive to write text but  costs almost nothing to distribute. 

Other kinds of media, audio, images, and video, have also become much cheaper to distribute.
I provide these examples, farming, industrialization, and computers, to show that we can talk about what they made cheep with with out talking about how they work. I also hope that these descriptions make clear that it is what they commoditize is what drives there impact.
This brings me to the core question I want to ask: What dose and what will AI commoditize?
Language? Knowledge? Inelegance?
What kinds of impact can we expect if each of these truly becomes a commodity?
